# Cursor Rules for nihon-go project

# DATABASE PROTECTION RULES
# -------------------------------
# CRITICAL: Never perform database operations without explicit permission
# This includes but is not limited to:
# - prisma migrate (dev/deploy/reset)
# - prisma db (push/pull/seed)
# - Any SQL operations that modify schema
# - Any operations that clear or reset data

# REQUIRED WORKFLOW:
# 1. ALWAYS explain database changes first
# 2. ALWAYS ask for explicit permission before executing ANY database operation
# 3. NEVER assume permission is granted for database operations
# 4. ALWAYS show the commands that would be run, but DO NOT run them automatically

# These rules apply to all environments (development, staging, production)
# No exceptions to these rules are permitted without explicit user authorization
